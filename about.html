            <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I am a professional Maths and Physics Tutor with 30 years of experience. I live in Wollaton, Nottingham, just 3 minutes walk from 2 NCT bus routes. I have helped over 1300 children with Maths, Science, and Physics. I specialize in exam preparation and have excellent references and feedback from many satisfied parents. I have also marked exam papers and can guide students to the essential key points to gain maximum marks.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i> My Experience</h2>
            <p>With 30+ years of tutoring experience and a Masters degree in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Loughborough University, I bring both academic expertise and practical teaching strategies to every session. I’ve worked with a wide range of students, each with unique goals and learning styles. I tutor online and in person from Primary, KS3, GCSE and A-level and also have experience with Adult learners and children with SEN. I use Zoom/Skype and have a Graphics tablet/pen allowing me to write onto the screen and share screens. I send any notes, summaries or questions done on the screen at the end. I have over 100 online textbooks/workbooks and digital lessons which I share online or by email. I am very experienced and fluent with using online portals such as MyMaths, SPARX & MathsWatch and know how to use them effectively to their full potential to aid progress and learning. I use online quizzes and tests to check understanding and make lessons interactive.
                Many of my students continue with sessions for 5 or 6 years along with their siblings. Nearly all of my students improve by at least 2 or 3 grades from their starting position. I cover all the main exam boards including AQA, Edexcel and OCR.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Why Choose Me?</h2>
            <p>Every session is tailored to your specific needs, whether you're aiming for a top grade or just want to feel more confident. I focus on building strong foundations, exam technique, and problem-solving skills — all in a supportive environment. I have a patient, friendly and flexible approach and am successful since I adjust my teаching style to match eаch student. I like to make my sessions as enjoyable and interactive as possible in order to motivate and engage my students. I provide real life examples which helps understanding and gives purpose. I simplify complex problems/topics into smaller, manageable tasks or points. I guide students to the correct path by asking key, well-timed questions or hints. I carry out an initial assessment and then create a schedule, targeting weaker topics. I review work regularly and I always provide weekly homework at the end of each session to help practice the concepts learnt in the lesson and regularly provide feedback to parents. I test students on material covered a few weeks earlier to ensure it has been retained.

                I work on exam questions early allowing time to progress onto more challenging questions. I give guidance on efficient techniques, time planning and the best approach for all the various types of exam questions.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> My Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Everyone can do well in Maths and Physics with the right mindset and support. My goal is to help you enjoy learning, reduce stress, and develop a real understanding that will last beyond the exam room.</p>
